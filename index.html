    <h1>HAPPY TEACHER DAY</h1>
    <p>DEAR TEACHERS

        I thank you for everything
        you've done, what you have
          taught me I will not outgrow.
        Your kind attention touched
          my mind and heart, in many
        ways that you will never know.
          I WILL REMEMBER YOU
            MY WHOLE LIFE THROUGH;
        I wish that all my teachers
          were quite like you.  </p>
